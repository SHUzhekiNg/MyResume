\cventry{Automatic descriptor acquisition method for NASICON electrolyte}
  {May 2022 -- Mar 2023}
  [Group Member, supervised by Prof Y. Liu in Shanghai University]
  [Shanghai, China]
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Overview}: Using the text mining method, descriptors can be extracted from small batch of NASICON solid electrolyte documents and trained based on this model to achieve automatic and efficient acquisition of NASICON solid electrolyte descriptors.
    \item \textbf{Content}: Using \textbf{Vue} to develop front-end interfaces and the back-end deployment using \textbf{Springboot} to communicate with \textbf{MySQL} and \textbf{Neo4j} databases. BERT algorithm are deployed using \textbf{Pytorch} for paper processing, and the extracted descriptors are used to construct the knowledge map using \textbf{Neo4j} database.
  \end{itemize}
